üìä Analysis of the 2024 Stack Overflow Developer Survey







üîç Overview
This project explores global developer trends and salary dynamics using a machine learning pipeline built around the CRISP-DM methodology. Using the 2024 Stack Overflow Developer Survey (65,000+ responses from 185+ countries), I implemented end-to-end data science workflows from cleaning and feature engineering to clustering, classification, and model evaluation.









üéØ Objectives
Identify key demographic, professional, and organizational factors driving high developer salaries.
Segment developers into distinct clusters (archetypes) based on experience, role, and company size.
Build and evaluate predictive models to classify high-income vs. low-income developers.










üß© Workflow & Methods
CRISP-DM framework used to structure machine learning experimentation and insights.
Data preprocessing included:
Cleaning and validating the dataset (23,000+ rows post-cleaning)
Mode imputation for missing categorical values and IQR-based outlier capping
One-Hot Encoding for categorical variables and feature scaling with StandardScaler
Feature selection guided by salary correlations with education, country, job type, years of experience, and company size
Data visualization using box plots, heatmaps, scatter plots, and bar charts













üîó Clustering Analysis
Implemented K-Means and Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering
Optimal clusters determined with the Elbow Method and Silhouette Scores (k=2)
PCA visualization showed clear separation:
Cluster 0: Senior, specialized developers in large organizations
Cluster 1: Versatile developers, freelancers, and full-stack developers in smaller orgs













ü§ñ Machine Learning Models
Model	Accuracy	AUC	Notes
Logistic Regression	82.93%	0.90	Best-performing, interpretable coefficients
Random Forest	81.13%	0.88	Strong for non-linear relationships
k-Nearest Neighbours	73.28%	0.79	Sensitive to feature scaling
Decision Trees	73.22%	0.80	Interpretable, prone to overfitting
Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve
Hyperparameter tuning with cross-validation for optimal performance










üí° Key Findings
Developer seniority, specialization, and organization size strongly influence salary outcomes
Logistic Regression is the most reliable and interpretable model for predicting high-income developers
Random Forest shows strong performance on complex datasets with high variance
Clear segmentation of developer personas enables salary benchmarking and targeted hiring strategies
